# pyRedditScreenshot

**A simple script that will:**

1) screenshot each subreddit from a list 

2) upload the screenshot to imgbb

3) enter the link to the screenshot into a mongodb along with other cool information like subscribers and active users

---
my mongodb is hard coded right now but that could easily be changed
